## The Problem
Sea ice is both in motion and evolves through time.  Ice floes sampled by ICESat-2, and therefore, freeboard segments will not be fixed in space.  #segtrax will develop a tool that generates trajectories of freeboard segments using ice motion data - initially from NSIDC but other motion data could be used.    An additional utility would be to evolve ice thickness using a simple freezing degree day ice growth model.
